# Todo-List
A simple console-based To-Do List program in Python

Run the 'main.py' file. The program provides a simple menu to add tasks, remove tasks, view tasks, and exit the To-Do List program. The tasks are stored in memory during the program's execution, and they will be lost once the program is closed.
